## Heading ##
Branch the roots of your community.

## Sub-Heading ##
Audience: 
* Non-profits looking to post open volunteer shifts and manage their volunteer schedule
* Volunteers looking to fill open volunteer shifts, manage their schedule, and connect with other schedulers over social media, recieving badges for completed shifts at different non-profits.

## Summary ##
One-stop-shop to match and manage interactions between volunteers with non-profits.

## Problem ##
Non-profits struggle to keep track of their volunteers and have more important things to manage than a schedule. On the same token, it can be harder for people to reach out to help causes they're passionate about, when they aren't aware of what's available to them or even what non-profts are in proximity to their location.

## Solution ##
Our app takes care of the vetting and scheduling process for non-profits and connects volunteers to open opportunities they're passionate about.
